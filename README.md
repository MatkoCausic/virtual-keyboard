# virtual-keyboard
This is my first project that I wanted to make myself. I first started out remaking pages from frontendmentor.io.
Wanted to learn basics of HTML and CSS because my main goal is to learn more advanced stuff (JavaScript frameworks and libraries)
which are used for professional programming.

With each new project I put out, you can see how I started to get a better grasp of things. Stopped using 'margin' and 'padding'
commands to position elements in html, started using CSS variables for colors, * for global declaration etc.
When I found out about SCSS and how variable declaration looks oh so much better (Sass in 100 seconds:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDIJa0AP5c&t=68s&ab_channel=Fireship ), I wanted to start a new project in which I would implement
it as soon as possible. That's when I came up with 'virtual keyboard' project idea.

I also wanted to make 'virtual keyboard' project to get the grasp of DOM part of JavaScript. I finally think I understand enough of HTML
and CSS to make that transition (I came to that conclusion when I searched and read an article on flexboxes:
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ ).

First I made the design and coloring of my keyboard which, by design and style, replicates my IRL Keychron keyboard
( https://www.keychron.com/collections/keychron-k-pro-series-keyboard/products/keychron-k2-pro-qmk-via-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=40336733503577 ).
I wanted to make some space between the letters and remove button borders, but for now I'll leave that for future me because I wanted to start on
JS part of the project which takes us to the second point.

When I made JS text file, I left it blank for 1 hour because my plan
was to make keyboard output letters on the screen below and I didn't know how. Went on some w3schools tutorials and tried typing
some petty code, but with no progress. Screw it, asked ChatGPT and after approximately 15 indivitual attempts to write the code I
asked it to, I finally had my first 12 lines of working code just after 3 hours of attempting.

Later on I figured it out myself how to make backspace button, space, caps-lock buttons functional. Now I'm currently working on 'calculator mode'
which will enable numbers to parse to int and make simple equations possible.
